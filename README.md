1. Initiate the SimpleNN: This contains an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer
  
2. The MNIST is a large database containing handwritten digits in greyscale. These images are 28x28 pixels which must be transformed into
1D Tensors to pass through the neural network

3. training the data through 5 epochs & a learning rate of 0.001.
